Evaluation of Companies with an Android Application

Android application that focuses on evaluating and comparing the quality of business offerings. The app will show us a list of
businesses ranked by rating. It allows us to search for a business according to our requirements, to evaluate its services and offer. In addition, we can add a business to
favorites, view it on a map, or write a review. This work deals with the analysis of Android application creation, application design and implementation. The NoSQL Cloud
Firestore BETA database was used and the storage space was implemented using Firebase technology. The Google Maps Geocoding API has been used to display the business on the map.
